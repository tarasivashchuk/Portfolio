## Summary
Built a business intelligence chatbot which served as the startups minimum-viable product (MVP), developing tools for processing queries with state-of-the-art NLP techniques such as transformers (such as GPT-2, BERT, etc.) as well as intelligently retrieving data and working it into a human-like response. 

## Scope 
	The founders of Orry.ai came to me with a vision and all of the concept formulation completed and in need of someone to build a working prototype with the core features they outlined that they could use as a demo and proof-of-concept. 
	The development decisions were left to me and I completed the project, with every requirement outlined in the beginning successfully implemented, building a basic three stage chatbot. The stages were broadly:
	1. Text processing cleaning up and standardizing the input query
	2. Natural language machine and/or deep learning models to interpret and classify the processed user query
	3. Data retrieval framework for looking up any required data, both public and proprietary, needed for the response
	4. Natural language model, specifically a transformer (examples include GPT-2  and BERT), to use the data and the question classification to formulate a human-like response.
