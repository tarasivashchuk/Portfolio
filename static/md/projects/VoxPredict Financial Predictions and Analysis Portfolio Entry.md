## Summary
Starting with little more than a vague idea, built all the tooling and machine/deep learning for performing high-level analysis of financial markets, incorporating models utilizing data of all kinds - numerical, text, audio, and more. As well as all the tooling for data gathering, data processing, visualization, analysis and all other needs for the project. This is my latest work and I am quite proud of both the huge effort and results of this project. 

## Scope
Project started over a phone call and a high-level idea, and was developed by me alone, and worked as a key person for making decisions as part of a team between the president of GWH Ventures LLC, Gary Heinz, and myself.
