## Summary
Built tooling and framework from the group-up which assessed resumes and job postings, along with other proprietary data, to predict how well a potential candidate matches for a job in order to increase the speed and quality of filling positions.

## Scope
I worked closely with a small team at ExpertHiring, who handled project management and direction, as well as deployment DevOps. I did all the development of the Python package from start to finish.
